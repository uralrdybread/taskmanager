# Simple Task Management App


## Goals
My goal for this application was as follows:

- **Create Efficient Routes**: I aimed to create a route file with as few lines of code as possible. This was achieved by utilizing the `Route::resource` method, which automatically generates all 7 RESTful route methods.

- **Practice Component Creation**: I aimed to reduce the amount of repeated code by practicing component creation throughout the application.

- **Slick Success Notifications**: I wanted to create fully functioning and visually appealing success notifications when a task is either removed or created. This was accomplished using Alpine.js and Tailwind CSS.

- **Dip my Toes into Tailwind**: I aimed to familiarize myself with Tailwind CSS and its inline nature to create a visually appealing interface.

- **Factory Class Implementation**: I implemented a factory class for generating fake data using Tinker.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
